# Compiler-Interpreter
Compiler and Interpreter for a 'toy' language. A project replicating the front-end of a compiler and an interpreter for a small language. I implemented a lexer producing tokens and a parser generating an abstract syntax tree for the language. The output from the front-end was used by an interpreter to execute the language on a virtual stack machine.
